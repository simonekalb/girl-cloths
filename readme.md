# Coding challenge example

This is the code I wrote for a coding challenge.
It fetchs a JSON file from a remote server, displays information in a tableview,
store all information in a database managed by Core Data and displays detail view of
each cloth with photos.

Tested with iOS 7.0 and iOS 8.0 on both iPhone 4/4s/5/5S/6/6+ and iPads running iOS7/8.

Done in less than 4h.
